# [3 Principles of Things](https://principle-of-things.github.io/)

Don't know who said it, but when you hear it, it certainly makes sense. These are three principles born from the experience of our predecessors.

1. To use something for a long time, maintenance is necessary.
2. To do something cheaply, knowledge is necessary.
3. To do something quickly, experience and wisdom are necessary.

Whether it's a computer, home appliance, furniture, or car, any **thing** requires "maintenance to be used for a long time," "knowledge to be done cheaply," and "experience and wisdom to be done quickly."

For those who don't have the time to gain knowledge or experience, the only option is to hire a professional and buy time. However, the know-how gained through trial and error over time is truly sustainable for long-term use of things.
